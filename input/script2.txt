Prince Charming: Once upon a time in a kingdom far far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy. Until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower there to await the kiss of the handsome prince charming!

Prince Charming: It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon’s keep. [crows caw] For he was the bravest, and most handsome… in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess’s chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her… [the prince gasps, seeing the Big Bad Wolf in Fiona's place]

Wolf: What?

Prince Charming: Princess…Fiona?

Wolf: No!

[The prince sighs of relief]

Prince Charming: Oh, thank heavens... where is she?

Wolf: She’s on her honeymoon.

Prince Charming: Honeymoon? With whom?!

[The scene changes to Shrek and Fiona entering their bridal suite.]

[Back to Shrek's Tree House]

Shrek: It’s so good to be home. [Donkey is singing and Fiona is giggling] Just you and me and…

Donkey: ♪ Two can be as bad as one… ♪

Fiona: Mom and Dad?

Shrek: Prince Charming?

Donkey: Shrek! Fiona! Aren’t you two a sight for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek, ya old love machine. [He chuckles] And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How about a side of sugar for the steed?

Shrek: Donkey, what are you doing here?

Donkey: Oh! I was just taking care of your love nest for you.

Shrek: Oh, you mean like…sorting the mail and watering the plants?

Donkey: Yeah, and feeding the fish!

Shrek: I don’t have any fish.

Donkey: You do now. I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona.

Donkey: That Shrek is a rascally devil. Get your…[mumbling]

Shrek: Look at the time. I guess you’d better be going.

Donkey: Don’t you want to tell me about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

Fiona: Actually, Donkey? Shouldn’t you be getting home to Dragon?

Donkey: Oh, yeah, that...I don't know. She’s been all moody and stuff lately...so I thought I’d move back in with you guys!

Fiona: You know we’re always happy to see you, Donkey.

Shrek: But Fiona and I are married now. We need a little time...you know...to be together.

Shrek: Just with each other...Alone.

Donkey: Say no more, say no more! You don’t have to worry about a thing.

Donkey: I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you!

Shrek: donkey.

Donkey: Yes roomie?

Shrek:...you're bothering me.

Donkey: Oh, OK. All right, cool.

Donkey: I guess uh…Me and Pinocchio were going to catch a tournament, anyway, so uh…maybe I’ll see y’all Sunday for a barbecue or something.

Shrek: He'll be fine.

Donkey: Now, where were we?

[He giggles.]

Donkey: Oh. I think I remember.

Shrek: Donkey!

Donkey: I know, I know! Alone! I’m going! I’m going. What do you want me to tell these other guys?

[fanfare]

[♪ theme to Hawaii Five-O]

Messenger: Enough, Reggie.

[he clears his throat and reads]

Messenger: "Dearest Princess Fiona. You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage at which time the King will bestow his royal blessing… upon you and your…"

Messenger: uh…

Messenger: "Prince Charming. Love, the King, and Queen of Far, Far Away. aka Mom and Dad."

Fiona: Mom and Dad?

Shrek: Prince Charming?

Donkey: Royal ball? Can I come?

Shrek: We’re not going.

Fiona & Donkey: What?

Shrek: I mean, don’t you think they might be a bit… shocked to see you like this?

Fiona: [chuckles] Well, they might be a bit surprised.

They love me.

And don’t worry.

They gonna love you, too.

Shrek: Yeah, right.

Somehow I don’t think I’ll be welcome at the country club.

Fiona: Will you stop it?

They’re not like that.

Shrek: then How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

Fiona: Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance.

Shrek: To do what, sharpen their pitchforks?

Fiona: No! They just want to give you their blessing.

Shrek: Oh, great. Now I need their blessing?

Fiona: Well, if you want to be a part of this family, yes!

Shrek: And who says I want to be part of this family?

Fiona: You did! When you married me!

Shrek: Well, there’s some fine print for you! Ugh!

Fiona: So that’s it. You won’t come?

Shrek: Trust me. It’s a bad idea.

We are not going, and that’s final!

Donkey: Hey Come on Shrek! We don’t wanna hit traffic!

Gingy: Don’t worry! We’ll take care of everything.

[Everyone cheers]

Blind Mouse: Hey, wait for me! Oof!

That’s not funny. hey That’s really immature.

This is why nobody likes ogres.

All right. Your loss!

Donkey- I’m gonna just stop talking!

Shrek- Finally!

Donkey: but This is taking forever, Shrek. There’s no in-flight movie or nothing.

Shrek: The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That’s where we’re going. Far, far… [softly] away.

Donkey: All right, all right, I get it. I’m just so darn BORED!

Shrek: Well, find a way to entertain yourself.

[Donkey sighs] [pop] [beat] [pop] [beat, Shrek is visibly getting angry] [pop]

Shrek: Oh!...

Shrek [as Fiona looks away and sighs]: For five minutes…

Shrek: Could you not be yourself...FOR FIVE MINUTES?!

    Donkey: Uh… Why don’t you guys go ahead? I’ll park the car.

    Fiona: Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look happy to see us.
    King Harold: [softly] Who on earth are they?
    Queen Lillian: [softly] I think that’s our little girl.
    King Harold: That’s not little! That’s a really big problem. Wasn’t she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell?
    Queen Lillian: Well, he’s no Prince Charming, but they do look…
    Shrek: [softly] Happy now? We came. We saw them. [nervous chuckle] Now let’s go before they light the torches.
    Fiona: They’re my parents.
    Shrek: Hello? They locked you in a tower.
    Fiona: Hey! That was for my own…
    King Harold: Good! Here’s our chance. Let’s go back inside and pretend we’re not home.
    Queen Lillian: Harold, we have to be…
    Shrek: Quick! While they’re not looking we can make a run for it.
    Fiona: Shrek, stop it! Everything’s gonna be…

    Shrek: Well, um…

It’s easy to see where Fiona

gets her good looks from.

[chuckles nervously][gulps][eating noises]

Fiona: [belches] Excuse me.

[Shrek & Fiona laugh]

Shrek: Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona?

[both giggle]

Shrek: That’s good. ...

I guess not.


Donkey- What do you mean, "not on the list"?

Don’t tell me you don’t know who I am.

[doors slam]

donkey- hey! What’s happening, everybody?

Thanks for waiting.

you know I had the hardest time finding this place.

King Harold: No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

Fiona: No, no, No, Dad! It’s all right. It’s all right. He’s with us. He helped rescue me from the dragon.

Donkey: Yep That’s me: the noble steed. Ay Waiter! How ‘bout a bowl for the steed?

Shrek: Oh, boy. [slurps]

Fiona: Um, Shrek?

Shrek: Yeah? Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs Q. [laughs and rubs his tummy] Mmm!

Fiona: No, no. Darling.

Shrek: [chuckles nervously] Oh!

Queen Lillian: So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.

Fiona: Well… Shrek owns his own land. Don’t you, honey?

Shrek: Oh, yes! It’s in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and…

Donkey- WHAT?! Hahahaha...

I know you ain’t talking about the swamp.

King Harold: An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original.

Queen Lillian: Well I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children.

King Harold: [splutters]

Shrek: [chokes] [spoon clinks on table] It’s a bit early to be thinking about that, isn’t it?

King Harold: Indeed. I just started eating.

Queen Lillian- Harold!

Shrek- What’s that supposed to mean?

Fiona - Dad. It’s great, OK?

King Harold: well For his type, yes.

Shrek: My type?

Donkey: uhhh I gotta go to the bathroom.

Chef: Dinner is served!

Donkey: Never mind. I can hold it.

Chef: Bon appetit

Donkey: Oh, Mexican food! My favorite.

Queen Lillian: Well Let’s not just sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in.

Donkey: Don’t mind if I do, Lillian.

King Harold: sooo I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be…

Shrek: Ogres, yes!

Queen Lillian: Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Right, Harold?

King Harold: Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don’t eat your own young!

Fiona: Dad!

Shrek: ohhh No, we usually prefer the ones who’ve been locked away in a tower!

Fiona: Shrek, please!

King Harold: I only did that because I love her.

Shrek: oh Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle.

King Harold: You wouldn’t understand. You’re not her father!

FIona: [sigh]

King Harold: It’s so nice to have the family together for dinner.

King Harold- I knew this would happen.

[Lillian] You should. You started it.

King Harold- I can hardly believe that, Lillian. He’s the ogre. Not me.

Queen Lillian- I think, Harold, you’re taking this

a little too personally.

This is Fiona’s choice.


King Harold- Yes But she was supposed to choose

the prince we picked out for her.


King Harold- I mean, you expect me to give

my blessings to this… this thing?


Queen Lillian- Fiona does.

And she’ll never forgive you if you don’t.

I don’t want to lose

our daughter again, Harold.

Oh, you act as if love

is totally predictable.

Don’t you remember when

we were young? And oh,

We used to walk

down by the lily pond and…

[harold sighs]

they were in bloom…

King Harold- Our first kiss.


It’s not the same!

I don’t think you realize that

our daughter has married a monster!


Queen Lillian- Oh, stop being such a drama king.

La, di, da, di, da!

Isn’t it all wonderful!


I’d like to know

how it could get any worse!

Queen lillian - What happened?

King Harold- Nothing, dear!


Just the old crusade wound

playing up a bit!

I’ll just stretch it

out here for a while.


FG- You better get in.

We need to talk.


King Harold- Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed.

[yawns] Already taken my pills,

and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.


So, um how about… we make this

a quick visit. What?


Oh, hello.

Ha-ha-ha!

So, what’s new?

FG- You remember my son, Prince Charming?

    Harold: Charming! Is that you? My gosh, it's been years! When did you get back?
    Charming: [irritated] Oh, about 5 minutes ago, actually. [Raised tone] After I endured blistering winds! And scorching desert! Climbed to the highest room of the tallest tower– [cut off by his mother]
    Fairy Godmother: Tut, tut, tut. Mummy can handle this. [to King Harold, using the same hostile tone Charming used earlier] He endures blistering winds and scorching desert! He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower, and what does he find?! Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married!

Harold- I mean, It wasn’t my fault. He didn’t get there in time.

FG- Stop the car! [crash] Harold. You force me to do something I really don’t want to do.

Harold- [gasps] Where are we?

Friars employee- well Hi there. Welcome to Friar’s Fat Boy! May I take your order?

Fairy Godmother: My diet is ruined! I hope you’re happy. Er… okay. Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo… chili rings…

Prince Charming: Yeah, I’ll have the Medieval Meal.

FG- One Medieval Meal and, Harold… Curly fries?

Harold- No, thank you.

Fairy Godmother: Sourdough soft taco, then?

Harold- No, really, I’m fine.

Friars Employee- Your order, Fairy Godmother. and This comes with the Medieval Meal.

FG- There you are, dear. you see We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don’t want me to go back on my part.

Harold- [sighs deeply] Indeed not.

FG- So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

Harold- Yes.

FG- Oh, Believe me, Harold. It’s what’s best. Not only for your daughter… but for your Kingdom.

Harold- What am I supposed to do about it?

Ah! There you are. Right.

You see, I need to have

someone taken care of.


Ugly Stepsister(Doris)- Who’s the guy?

Harold - Well, he’s not a guy, per se.


Um… He’s an ogre.

King Harold: Sorry. I hope I’m not interrupting anything.

Shrek: No, no. I was just reading a, uh… a scary book. I was hoping you’d let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier.

- Okay…

- I don’t know what came over me.

Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over…

- Look, Your Majesty, I just…

- Please. Call me Dad.

Dad. We both acted like ogres.

Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other.

Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt.

A little father-son time?

I know it would mean the world to Fiona.

[sighs]

Shall we say, 7:30 by the old oak?

[birds twitter]

[Shrek] Face it, Donkey!

We’re lost.

Donkey: We can’t be lost. We followed

the King’s instructions exactly.


"Head to the

darkest part of the woods…"


"Past the sinister trees

with scary-looking branches."


- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!

- We passed that three times already!


Donkey: You were the one who said

not to stop for directions.


Oh, great. My one chance

to fix things up with Fiona’s dad


and I end up lost

in the woods with you!


Don’t get huffy!

I’m only trying to help.


I know! I know.


- I’m sorry, all right?

- Hey, don’t worry about it.


I just really need to make

things work with this guy.


Yeah, sure. Now let’s go

bond with Daddy.


[purring]


[purring]


Well, well, well, Donkey.


I know it was kind of a tender

moment back there, but the purring?


What? I ain’t purring.


Sure. What’s next? A hug?


Donkey: Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don’t purr.

What do you think I am, some kind of a…?


Puss: Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare! [hisses]

Shrek: Look! A little cat.

Donkey: Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!

Shrek: It’s a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty.


- [screaming]

- Whoa!


- Hold on, Shrek! I’m coming!

- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!


Oh, God. Oh…


No!


- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!

- Get it off!


Shrek! Hold still!


[Donkey: Did I miss?

Shrek: No. You got them.


Puss: Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from… Puss… in Boots!


I’ll kill that cat!


Ah-ha-ha!


[coughs]


[wheezes]


[retches]


[coughs]


- [chuckles] Hairball.

- Oh! That is nasty!


What should we do with him?


Take the sword and neuter him.

Give him the Bob Barker treatment.


Oh, no! Por favor!

Please!


I implore you!

It was nothing personal, Señor.


I was doing it only for my family.


My mother, she is sick.

And my father lives off the garbage!


The King offered me much in gold

and I have a litter of brothers…


Whoa, whoa, whoa!


Fiona’s father paid you to do this?


The rich King? Sí.


[screams]


Well, so much for Dad’s royal blessing.


Don’t feel bad. Almost everybody

that meets you wants to kill you.


Gee, thanks.


Maybe Fiona would’ve been better off

if I were some sort of Prince Charming.


That’s what the King said.


Oh, uh… sorry. I thought that question

was directed at me.


Shrek, Fiona knows

you’d do anything for her.


Well, it’s not like

I wouldn’t change if I could.


I just… I just wish

I could make her happy.


Hold the phone…


"Happiness."


"A tear drop away."


Donkey! Think of the saddest thing

that’s ever happened to you!


Aw, man, where do I begin?


First there was the time that old farmer

tried to sell me for some magic beans.


Then this fool had a party and he have

the guests trying to pin the tail on me.


Then they got drunk and start beating me

with a stick, going "Piñata!!"


What is a piñata, anyway?


No, Donkey! I need you to cry!


Don’t go projecting on me.


I know you’re feeling bad,

but you got to…


Aaaahhh!


You little, hairy,

litter-licking sack of…


What? Is it on? Is it on?


[clears throat]


This is Fairy Godmother.


I’m either away

from my desk or with a client.


But if you come by the office, we’ll be

glad to make you an appointment.


Have a "happy ever after."


Oh…


Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?


That’s more like it! Shrek and Donkey,

on another whirlwind adventure!


Ain’t no stoppin’ us now! Whoo! We’re on the move!


- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.

- Join the club. We’ve got jackets.


On my honor, I am obliged to accompany

you until I have saved your life


as you have spared me mine.


The position of annoying talking animal

has already been taken.


Let’s go, Shrek. Shrek?


- Shrek!

- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him…


in his wee little boots.


You know, how many cats can wear boots?

Honestly.


- Let’s keep him!

- Say what?


[purrs]


Ahh!


Listen. He’s purring!


- Oh, so now it’s cute.

[trying to convince Donkey to let Puss in Boots join them] Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.


Lighten up? I should lighten up?

Look who’s telling who to lighten up!


Lighten up? I should lighten up?

Look who’s telling who to lighten up!


[giggles] Shrek!


[barks]


[barks]


Shrek?


They’re both festive, aren’t they?


What do you think, Harold?


Um… Yes, yes.

Fine. Fine.


[sighs]


Try to at least pretend you’re interested in your daughter’s wedding ball.


Honestly, Lillian,

I don’t think it matters.


How do we know there will even be a ball?


Mom. Dad.


- Oh, hello, dear.

- What’s that, Cedric? Right! Coming.


Mom, have you seen Shrek?


I haven’t. You should ask your father.


Be sure and use small words, dear.

He’s a little slow this morning.


- Can I help you, Your Majesty?

- Ah, yes! Um…


Mmm! Exquisite.

What do you call this dish?


That would be the dog’s breakfast,

Your Majesty.


Ah, yes. Very good, then.

Carry on, Cedric.


- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?

- No, I haven’t, dear.


I’m sure he just went off to look for a nice… mud hole to cool down in.


You know, after your little spat last night.


Oh. You heard that, huh?


The whole kingdom heard you.


I mean, after all,

it is in his nature to be…


well, a bit of a brute.


Him? You know, you didn’t exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon.


Well, what did you expect?

Look at what he’s done to you.


Shrek loves me for who I am.


I would think you’d be happy for me.


Darling, I’m just thinking about

what’s best for you.


Maybe you should do the same.


[both whisper]


No, really?


[both laugh]


[Shrek] Shh…


Oh…


[hooter blasts]


Oh, no. That’s the old Keebler’s place.

Let’s back away slowly.


Puss in Boots: That’s the Fairy Godmother’s cottage. She’s the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.

Shrek: Then why don’t we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!


[Puss in Boots

shrieks with laughter]


[Puss in Boots] He makes me laugh.


Hi. I’m here to see the…


Jerome: The Fairy Godmother.

I’m sorry. She is not in.


Jerome!

Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!


[sighs]


Yes, Fairy Godmother.

Right away.


Look, she’s not seeing

any clients today, OK?


That’s OK, buddy.

We’re from the union.


The union?


We represent the workers in all magical

industries, both evil and benign.


Oh! Oh, right.


Are you feeling at all

degraded or oppressed?


Uh… a little.

We don’t even have dental.


They don’t even have dental.


Okay, we’ll just have

a look around.


Oh. By the way.


I think it’d be better if the Fairy Godmother

didn’t know we were here.


- Know what I’m saying? Huh?

- Huh? Huh? Huh?


- Stop it.

- Of course. Go right in.


[voices and grinding machines]


[explosion]


A drop of desire.


[giggles] Naughty!


A pinch of passion.


[laughs]


And just a hint of…


lust!


[laughs]


- [Shrek] Excuse me.

- [gasps]


Sorry to barge in like this…


What in Grimm’s name

are you doing here?


Well, it seems

that Fiona’s not exactly happy.


Oh-ho-ho!


And there’s some question

as to why that is?


Well, let’s explore that, shall we?


Ah. P, P, P…

Princess. Cinderella.


Here we are.

"Lived happily ever after." Oh…


[laughs] No ogres!


Let’s see. Snow White.


A handsome prince.

Oh, no ogres.


Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!


Hansel and Gretel? No!

Thumbelina? No.


The Golden Bird,

the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman…


No, no, no, no, no!


You see, ogres don’t

live happily ever after.


All right, look, lady!


Don’t you point… those dirty green sausages at me!


Worker Elf: Your Monte Cristo and coffee. Oh! Sorry.

Shrek: Ah… that’s okay.


We were just leaving.


Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother.


Just… go.


Come on, guys.


[whistles tune]


TGIF, eh, buddy?


Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?


Get your fine Corinthian footwear

and your cat cheeks out of my face! Man, that stinks!


You don’t exactly smell like

a basket of roses.


- Well, one of these has got to help.

- I was just concocting this very plan!


Already our minds are becoming one.


Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on

licking ourselves, we’ll give you a call.


Shrek, this is a bad idea.


Look. Make yourself useful

and go keep watch.


Puss, do you think you

could get to those on top?


No problema, boss.

In one of my nine lives,


I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela.


Ha-ha-ha-ha!


Shrek, are you off your nut?


Donkey, keep watch.


Keep watch?

Yeah, I’ll keep watch.


I’ll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside.


I’ll laugh, too.

I’ll be giggling to myself.


- What do you see?

- Toad Stool Softener?


Donkey: I’m sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems.

Puss: Elfa Seltzer?

Shrek: Uh-uh.

Puss: Hex Lax?

Shrek: No! Try "handsome."


Sorry. No handsome.


Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?


Well, what does it do?


It says "Beauty Divine."


Donkey: In some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of all creatures. Especially us talking ones.

Shrek: [gasps] Donkey! That’ll have to do. We’ve got company.

Donkey: Can we get on with this?

Shrek: Hurry! Nice catch, Donkey!

Puss: [after Donkey catches the "Happily Ever After" potion in his mouth] Finally! A good use for your mouth.


[♪ Pete Yorn: Ever Fallen In Love]


Come on!


You spurn my natural emotions


You make me feel like dirt and I’m hurt


And if I start a commotion


I run the risk of losing you and that’s worse


Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love


In love with someone, ever fallen in love


In love with someone you shouldn’t have fallen in love with


Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love


In love with someone, ever fallen in love


With someone you shouldn’t have fallen in love with


Fallen in love with


Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn’t have fallen in love with


I don’t care whose fault it is.

Just get this place cleaned up!


And somebody bring me something

deep fried and smothered in chocolate!


- Mother!

- Charming. Sweetheart.


This isn’t a good time, pumpkin.

Mama’s working.


Whoa, what happened here?


- The ogre, that’s what!

Prince Charming: What? Where is he, Mom? I shall rend his head from his shoulders! I will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me!


Oh, put it away, Junior!

You’re still going to be king.


We’ll just have to come up

with something smarter.


Pardon. Um…


Everything is accounted for,

Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.


What?


Oh…


I do believe we can make

this work to our advantage.


Shrek: "Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. "For you and your true love. "If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. "Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."


- You both will be fine?

- I guess it means it’ll affect Fiona, too.


Hey, man, this don’t feel right.

My donkey senses are tingling all over.


Drop that jug o’ voodoo

and let’s get out of here.


It says, "Beauty Divine."

How bad can it be?


[sneezes]


See, you’re allergic to that stuff.

You’ll have a reaction.


And if you think that I’ll be smearing

Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!


Puss in Boots: Boss, just in case there is something

wrong with the potion… allow me to take the first sip. It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you.

Donkey: Oh, no, no. I don’t think so. If there’ll be any animal testing, I’ll do it. That’s the best friend’s job. Now give me that bottle.


How do you feel?


I don’t feel any different.

I look any different?


You still look like an ass to me.


Maybe it doesn’t work on donkeys.


- Well, here’s to us, Fiona.

- Shrek?


- You drink that, there’s no going back.

- I know.


- No more wallowing in the mud?

- I know.


- No more itchy butt crack?

- I know!


- But you love being an ogre!

- I know!


But I love Fiona more.


Shrek, no! Wait!


[gurgling]


[farts]


Got to be… I think you grabbed

the "Farty Ever After" potion.


Maybe it’s a dud.


Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.


[thunder rumbles]


Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.


I don’t want to die.
I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die!


Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I’m melting!


I’m melting!


It’s just the rain, Donkey.


[chuckles] Oh.


Don’t worry. Things seem bad

because it’s dark and rainy


and Fiona’s father hired

a sleazy hitman to whack you.


[hisses]


lt’ll be better in the morning.

You’ll see…


The sun’ll come out…


Tomorrow


[yawns]


Bet your bottom…


Bet my bottom?


I’m coming, Elizabeth!


Donkey?


Are you all right?


- Hey, boss. Let’s shave him.

- D-Donkey?


[groans]


[Puss In Boots shrieks]


There you are!

We missed you at dinner.


What is it, darling?


Dad…


I’ve been thinking

about what you said.


And I’m going to set things right.


Ah! Excellent!

That’s my girl.


It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.


I’m going to go out and find him.


And then we’ll go back

to the swamp where we belong.


[Lillian] Fiona, please!


Let’s not be rash, darling.

You can’t go anywhere right now.


[rain patters]


[Both] Fiona!


Look, I told you he was here.

Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.


[Shrek groans]


Good morning, sleepyhead.


[Shrek shouts]


[All] Good morning!


We love your kitty!


- [Shrek] Oh… My head…

- Here, I fetched a pail of water.


    Shrek: Thanks. Uhh! Aahh! Oh… [examines his new, human body] A cute, button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks?! I’m… I’m…


- Gorgeous!

- I’ll say.


I’m Jill. What’s your name?


- Um… Shrek.

- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?


- You’re tense.

- I want to rub his shoulders.


- I got it covered.

- I don’t have anything to rub.


Get in line.


Get in line.


- Have you seen my donkey?

- Who are you calling donkey?


- Donkey? You’re a…

- A stallion, baby!


I can whinny.


[whinnies]

I can count.


Look at me, Shrek!

I’m trotting!


That’s some quality potion.

What’s in that stuff?


"Oh, don’t take the potion,

Mr. Boss, it’s very bad."


Pah!


"Warning: Side effects may include

burning, itching, oozing, weeping.


"Not intended for heart patients

or those with… nervous disorders."


I’m trotting, I’m trotting in place! Yeah!


What?


Puss in Boots: Señor? "To make the effects of this potion permanent, the drinker must obtain his true love’s kiss by midnight."


Shrek: Midnight? Why is it always midnight?


- Pick me! I’ll be your true love!

- I’ll be your true love.


I’ll be true… enough.


Look, ladies, I already have a true love.


[all] Oh…


And take it from me, Boss.


You are going to have

one satisfied Princess.


And let’s face it.

You are a lot easier on the eyes.


Inside you’re the same

old mean, salty…


- Easy.

…cantankerous, foul,


angry ogre you always been.


And you’re still the same

annoying donkey.


- Yeah.

- [sighs]


Well…


Look out, Princess.

Here comes the new me.


First things first.


- We need to get you out of those clothes.

- [all gasp]


- Ready?

- Ready!


- [Donkey screams]

- Driver, stop!


Oh, God! Help me, please! My racing days are over!   I’m blind! Tell the truth. Will I ever play the violin again?


You poor creature!


Is there anything

I can do for you?


Well, I guess there is one thing.


Take off the powdered wig

and step away from your drawers.


- Not bad.

- Not bad at all.


[both laugh]


Father?

Is everything all right, Father?

    Shrek: [after robbing two men of their clothes] Thank you, gentlemen! Someday, I will repay you. Unless, of course, I can't find you or if I forget.


- [whinnies]

- [Puss in Boots, in angry Spanish]


[♪ Butterfly Boocher: Changes]


Oh, yeah


Turn and face the strange


Ch-Ch-Changes


Don’t wanna be a richer one


Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes


Turn and face the strange


Ch-Ch-Changes


Just gonna have to be a different man


Time may change me


But I can’t trace time


Halt!


Tell Princess Fiona her husband,

Sir Shrek, is here to see her.


Still don’t know what I was looking for


And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets


Every time I thought I’d got it made


It seemed the taste was not so sweet


- [screams]

- Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes


Turn and face the strange


- Shrek?

- Ch-Ch-Changes


Don’t wanna be a richer one


Time may change me


But I can’t trace time


Fiona?


Hello, handsome.


Shrek!


- Princess!

- Donkey?


Wow! That potion

worked on you, too?


What potion?


Shrek and I took some magic potion.

And well…


Now, we’re sexy!


Shrek?


[purrs]


For you, baby… I could be.


- Yeah, you wish.

- Donkey, where is Shrek?


He went inside looking for you.


Shrek?


Fiona! Fiona!


You want to dance, pretty boy?


Are you going so soon?

Don’t you want to see your wife?


Fiona?


Shrek?


Aye, Fiona. It is me.


What happened to your voice?


The potion changed

a lot of things, Fiona.


But not the way I feel about you.


Fiona?


- Charming?

- Do you think so?


[laughs] Dad. I was so hoping

you’d approve.


- Um… Who are you?

- Mom, it’s me, Shrek.


I know you never get a second chance

at a first impression,


but, well, what do you think?


[Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona!


Fiona!


- Fiona!

- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!


Oh, shoot! I don’t think they

can hear us, pigeon.


[sighs deeply]


Don’t you think you’ve already

messed her life up enough?


I just wanted her to be happy.


And now she can be.


Oh, sweetheart.


She’s finally found

the prince of her dreams.


But look at me.

Look what I’ve done for her.


It’s time you stop living

in a fairy tale, Shrek.


She’s a princess,

and you’re an ogre.


That’s something no amount

of potion will ever change.


But…


I love her.


If you really love her…


you’ll let her go.


[♪ Nick Cave: People Ain’t No Good]


Shrek?


Señor.


What’s going on?

Where are you going?


You wouldn’t have had anything to do

with this, would you, Harold?


People just ain’t no good


I think that’s well understood


There you go, boys.


Just leave the bottle, Doris.


Hey. Why the long face?


It was all just a stupid mistake.


I never should have rescued her

from that tower in the first place.


Puss: I hate Mondays.


I can’t believe you’d walk away from

the best thing that happened to you.


What choice do I have?


She loves that pretty boy,

Prince Charming.


Come on. Is he really

that good-looking?


Are you kidding?

He’s gorgeous!


He has a face that looks like

it was carved by angels.


- Oh. He sounds dreamy.

- You know…


shockingly, this isn’t

making me feel any better.


Look, guys.

It’s for the best.


Mom and Dad approve,


and Fiona gets the man

she’s always dreamed of.


Everybody wins.


Except for you.


I don’t get it, Shrek.

You love Fiona.


Aye.


And that’s why

I have to let her go.


Excuse me, is she here?


She’s, uh… in the back.


Oh, hello again.


Fairy Godmother. Charming.


You’d better have a good reason

for dragging us down here, Harold.


Well, I’m afraid Fiona isn’t really…

warming up to Prince Charming.


- FYI, not my fault.

- No, of course it’s not, dear.


I mean,

how charming can I be


when I have to pretend

I’m that dreadful ogre?


No, no, it’s nobody’s fault.


Perhaps it’s best if we just

call the whole thing off, okay?


- [both] What?

- You can’t force someone to fall in love!


I beg to differ.

I do it all the time!


Have Fiona drink this and she’ll fall in love

with the first man she kisses,


which will be Charming.


- Umm… no.

- What did you say?


I can’t. I won’t do it.


Oh, yes, you will.


If you remember, I helped you

with your happily ever after.


And I can take it away

just as easily.


Is that what you want? Is it?


King Harold: No.

- Good boy.


Now, we have to go.


I need to do Charming’s hair

before the ball.


He’s hopeless.

He’s all high in the front.


He can never get to the back.

You need someone to do the back.


Oh. Thank you, Mother.


[Donkey] Mother?


Shrek: Um… Mary! A talking horse!


The ogre!


Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!

Stop them!


(Announcer) The abs are fab

and it’s gluteus to the maximus


here at tonight’s Far, Far Away

Royal Ball blowout!


The coaches are lined up

as the cream of the crop pours out of them


like Miss Muffet’s curds and whey.


Everyone who’s anyone

has turned out


to honor Princess Fiona

and Prince Shrek.


And, oh my,

the outfits look gorgeous!


Look! Hansel and Gretel!


What the heck are the crumbs for?


And right behind them,

Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!


- Oh, aren’t they adorable!

- [screaming]


[woman] Here comes Sleeping Beauty!


Tired old thing.


Who’s this? Who’s this?

Who is this?


Oh. It’s the one, it’s the only…


It’s the Fairy Godmother!


Hello, Far, Far Away!


Can I get a whoop whoop?


May all your endings be happy and…


Well, you know the rest!


We’ll be right back with the Royal Far, Far Away Ball after these messages.


Gingerbread Man: I hate these ball shows. They bore me to tears. Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!


Pinocchio: I’m not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.


Gingerbread Man: Whizzes on you guys. Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing! No, to your left. Your left!


Announcer: Tonight on "Knights"…

Gingerbread Man: Now here’s a good show!


We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup.


It’s time to teach these madcap mammals


their "devil may mare" attitudes

just won’t fly.


Why you grabbing me?

Police brutality!


I have to talk to Princess Fiona!


- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!


Man on voice over: Wanna get away with it? Or did someone let the cat out of the bag?

Puss in Boots: You capitalist pig dogs!

[shrieks]


- Catnip!

Puss: That’s, uh, not mine.


Find Princess Fiona!


I’m a donkey!


Shrek: Tell her Shrek… I’m her husband, Shrek!


Gingerbread Man: Quick! Rewind it!

[The part rewinds and then plays]


Shrek: I’m her husband, Shrek! Ow!


[knock on door]


Darling?


Ah. I thought I might

find you here.


How about a nice hot cup

of tea before the ball?


I’m not going.


The whole Kingdom’s turned out

to celebrate your marriage.


There’s just one problem.

That’s not my husband.


I mean, look at him.


Yes, he is a bit different,


but people change

for the ones they love.


You’d be surprised how much

I changed for your mother.


Change?


He’s completely lost his mind!


Why not come down to the ball

and give him another chance?


You might find you like

this new Shrek.


But it’s the old one

I fell in love with, Dad.


I’d give anything to have him back.


King Harold: Darling. That’s mine. Decaf.


Otherwise I’m up all night.


Thanks.


Donkey: I gotta get out of here! You can’t lock us up like this! Let me go! What about my Miranda rights? You’re supposed to say, I have the right to remain silent. Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!


Shrek: You have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity.


Puss in Boots: I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad.


Pinocchio: Shrek? Donkey?


Puss in Boots: Too late.


Shrek: Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here!


Oh…


[♪ Theme from Mission Impossible]


Pig 1: Fire in ze hole!


[explosion]


Look out below!


Shrek: Quick! Tell a lie!


- What should I say?

- Anything, but quick!


Donkey: Say something crazy like "I’m wearing ladies’ underwear!"


Pinocchio: I am wearing ladies’ underwear.


- Are you?

- I most certainly am not!


It looks like you most certainly am are!


- I am not!

Puss In Boots: What kind?

    Gingy: It’s a thong!

    Pinocchio: Oww! They’re briefs!

Gingy: Are not!

- Are too!


- Are not!

- Are too!


Here we go. Hang tight.


[Donkey] Wait, wait, wait!

Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!


Ow!


- Excuse me?

- What? Puss!


Pardon me, would you

mind letting me go?


- Sorry, boss.

- Quit messing around!


We’ve got to stop that kiss!


I thought you was going

to let her go.


I was, but I can’t let them

do this to Fiona.


Donkey: Boom! That’s what I like to hear. Look who’s coming around!

Puss in Boots: It’s impossible! We’ll never get in. The castle’s guarded and there’s a moat and everything.


Gingy: Well, folks, it looks like we’re up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick.


- What?

Shrek: Do you still know the Muffin Man?


Gingy: Well, sure!He’s down on Drury Lane. Why?

Shrek: Because we’re gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour.


Gingy!


Gingy: Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We’ve got a big order to fill!


[evil chuckling]


[Gingy] It’s alive!


[rumbling]


[gasping]


Donkey: [whinnies] Run, run, run, as fast you can!


[screaming]


Gingy: Go, baby, go!


There it is, Mongo!

To the castle!


[Shrek] No, you great stupid pastry!

Come on!


[people screaming]


[Donkey] Mongo! Down here!

Look at the pony!


That’s right! Follow the pretty pony!


Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!


[Mongo] Pretty pony.


Ladies and gentlemen,


Presenting Princess Fiona

and her new husband, Prince Shrek!


[applause]


Shrek, what are you doing?


I’m just playing the part, Fiona.


Is that glitter on your lips?


Prince Charming: Mm. Cherry flavored.

Want to taste?


- Ugh! What is with you?

- But, Muffin Cake…


C Minor, put it in C Minor.


Ladies and gentlemen!


[applause, cheering]


I’d like to dedicate this song to…


Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek!


Fiona, my Princess.


Will you honor me with a dance?


Where have all the good men gone


And where are all the gods?


[all chanting] Dance!


Where’s the streetwise Hercules


To fight the rising odds?


Since when do you dance?


Fiona, my dearest,

if there’s one thing I know,


it’s that love is full of surprises.


Late at night I toss and I turn


And I dream of what I need


Hit it!


I need a hero


Shrek: All right, big fella! Let’s crash this party!


Man the catapults!


Aim! Fire!


- Brace yourselves!

- Ooh! Purty!


[groaning]


Not the gumdrop button!


[enraged howling]


Incoming!


Ha-ha! All right!


Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy


Shrek: Go, Mongo! Go!


Man the cauldrons!


After you, Mongo.


- That’s it! Heave-ho!

- Watch out!


Donkey: Shrek!


Knight: More heat, less foam!


Up where the mountains Meet the heavens above


Out where the lightning Splits the sea


I could swear there is someone Somewhere watching me


Heave! Ho!


[Gingy, slow-motion] No!


[Mongo groans]


Shrek: [whistles] Come on!


[cheering]


Look out!


- Be good.

- [weeping]


[sobbing] He needs me!

Let me go!


Donkey!


Puss!


Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!


Today, I repay my debt.


[all] Aww…


Puss in Boots: [growling] On guard!


He’s gotta be strong And he’s gotta be fast


And he’s gotta be fresh From the fight


- I need a hero

- Stop!

King Harold: Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea.

Gingy: Yup.


[croaking]


Gingy: He croaked.


Queen Lilian: Harold?


Fiona: Dad?

King Harold: I’d hoped you’d never see me like this.


Donkey: And he gave you a hard time!

- Donkey!


King Harold: No, no, he’s right. I’m sorry. To both of you. I only wanted what was best for Fiona. But I can see now… she already has it. Shrek, Fiona… Will you accept an old frog’s apologies… and my blessing?


Queen Lilian: Harold?

King Harold: I’m sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be the man you deserve.

Queen Lilian: You’re more that man today than you ever were… warts and all.


King Harold: [ribbits]


[clock chimes]


    Puss: Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!
    Shrek: Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you want? To be this way forever?

    Fiona: What?

Shrek: Because if you kiss me now…we can stay like this.


You’d do that?


- For me?

- Yes.


I want what any princess wants.


To live happily ever after…


with the ogre I married.


Puss in Boots: Whatever happens, I must not cry! You cannot make me cry!


[sobbing]


[clock chimes]


Whoa!


No. No, no.

Aaah! Ow.


Oh, no.


[sighs]


Shrek: [laughs] Hey. You still look like

a noble steed to me.


[giggles] Now, where were we?


Oh. I remember.


[giggling]


[applause]

Puss:  Hey! Isn’t we supposed to be having a fiesta?


Donkey: Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!


[♪ Eddie Murphy/Antonio Banderas:

Livin’ La Vida Loca]


Puss and Donkey, y’all…


She’s into superstitions


Black cats and voodoo dolls


- Sing it, Puss!

Puss In Boots: I feel a premonition


That girl’s gonna make me fall


Here we go!


She’s into new sensations


New kicks in the candlelight


She’s got a new addiction


For every day and night


She’ll make you take your clothes off


And go dancing in the rain


She’ll make you live her crazy life


But she’ll take away your pain


Like a bullet to your brain


Upside inside out


Living la vida loca


Hey gorgeous!


Living la vida loca


Her lips are devil red


And her skin’s the color of mocha


She will wear you out


- Living la vida loca

- [Donkey] She livin’ it loca!


Living la vida loca


- [Donkey] Say it one more time now!

- Living the vida loca


[Puss in Boots jamming]


[Puss in Boots]

Hey, Donkey, that’s Spanish!


She’ll push and pull you down


Living la vida loca


She will wear you out


Living la vida loca


Living la vida loca


She’ll push and pull you down


Living the vida loca


Her lips are devil red


And her skin’s the color of mocha


She will wear you out


Living la vida loca


Living la vida loca


Living la vida loca


Living la vida loca

[The song ends, and it cuts to black.]

Donkey: All by myself. Don’t wanna be All by myself anymore…

Puss: Amigo, we are off to the Kit-Kat Club. Come on, join us.

Donkey: Thanks, compadre. I’m… I’m not in the mood.

Puss: We will cheer you up! Find you a nice burro!

[roaring]

Donkey: Hey, baby! Hey, that’s my girl! Yeah! All right! Baby, where you been?

- [cries]

Donkey: I’m sorry, too. I should’ve stayed. But Shrek had this thing he had to do. What? Say it one more time. What you talking about? Are you serious?

- [cooing]

- [gasping]

- Papa!

- [screaming]

- [cooing, squealing] - [chuckling]

Donkey: Look at our little mutant babies! I got to get a job.
