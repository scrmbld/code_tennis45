 It’s so good to be home. [Donkey is singing and Fiona is giggling] Just you and me and…
 Prince Charming?
 Donkey, what are you doing here?
 Oh, you mean like…sorting the mail and watering the plants?
 I don’t have any fish.
 Look at the time. I guess you’d better be going.
 But Fiona and I are married now. We need a little time...you know...to be together.
 Just with each other...Alone.
 donkey.
 He'll be fine.
 Donkey!
 Prince Charming?
 We’re not going.
 I mean, don’t you think they might be a bit… shocked to see you like this?
 Yeah, right.
 then How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band?
 To do what, sharpen their pitchforks?
 Oh, great. Now I need their blessing?
 And who says I want to be part of this family?
 Well, there’s some fine print for you! Ugh!
 Trust me. It’s a bad idea.
 No.
 No!
 Yes.
 No!
 No, we're not!
 The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That’s where we’re going. Far, far… [softly] away.
 Well, find a way to entertain yourself.
 Oh!...
 Could you not be yourself...FOR FIVE MINUTES?!
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!
 ARE WE THERE YET!?
 So… [chuckles] you still think this was a good idea?
 [softly] Happy now? We came. We saw them. [nervous chuckle] Now let’s go before they light the torches.
 Hello? They locked you in a tower.
 Quick! While they’re not looking we can make a run for it.
 I really…
 don’t…
 to…
 Well, um…
 Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona?
 That’s good. ...
 Oh, boy. [slurps]
 Yeah? Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs Q. [laughs and rubs his tummy] Mmm!
 [chuckles nervously] Oh!
 Oh, yes! It’s in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and…
 [chokes] [spoon clinks on table] It’s a bit early to be thinking about that, isn’t it?
 My type?
 Ogres, yes!
 ohhh No, we usually prefer the ones who’ve been locked away in a tower!
 oh Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle.
 Fiona!
 Fiona? Fiona?
 well Here’s a news flash for you! Whether your parents like it or not… I am an ogre!
 No, no. I was just reading a, uh… a scary book. I was hoping you’d let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier.
 Look! A little cat.
 It’s a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty.
 No. You got them.
 Then why don’t we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!
 Ah… that’s okay.
 Uh-uh.
 No! Try "handsome."
 [gasps] Donkey! That’ll have to do. We’ve got company.
 Hurry! Nice catch, Donkey!
 "Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. "For you and your true love. "If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. "Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."
 Thanks. Uhh! Aahh! Oh… [examines his new, human body] A cute, button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks?! I’m… I’m…
 Midnight? Why is it always midnight?
 [after robbing two men of their clothes] Thank you, gentlemen! Someday, I will repay you. Unless, of course, I can't find you or if I forget.
 Um… Mary! A talking horse!
 Tell her Shrek… I’m her husband, Shrek!
 I’m her husband, Shrek! Ow!
 You have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity.
 Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here!
 Quick! Tell a lie!
 Do you still know the Muffin Man?
 Because we’re gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour.
 All right, big fella! Let’s crash this party!
 Go, Mongo! Go!
 [whistles] Come on!
 Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
 Now!
 Pinocchio! Get the wand!
 No!
 Fiona.
 Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you want? To be this way forever?
 Because if you kiss me now…we can stay like this.
